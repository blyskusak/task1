# Go

- Go is a high-level general purpose programming language that is statically typed and compiled . It is known for the simplicity of its syntax and the efficiency of development that it enables by the inclusion of a large standard library supplying many needs for common projects.  It was designed at Google  in 2009 by Robert Griesemer , Rob Pike , and Ken Thompson .  It is syntactically similar to C , but also has memory safety , garbage collection , structural typing ,  and CSP -style concurrency .  It is often referred to as Golang to avoid ambiguity and because of its former domain name, golang.org , but its proper name is Go.
