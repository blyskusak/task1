# Assembly language

- In computer programming , assembly language (alternatively assembler language  or symbolic machine code ),    often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm , is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions .  Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but  constants, comments , assembler directives ,  symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations , registers , and macros   are generally also supported.
