# SQL

- Structured Query Language ( SQL ) ( pronounced / ˌ ɛ s ˌ k j u ˈ ɛ l / S-Q-L ; or alternatively as / ˈ s iː k w ə l / "sequel")   is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data , i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
